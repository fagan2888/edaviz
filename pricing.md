- :clock1: Time is always tight on Data Science projects. With edaviz, our **regular edaviz users save at least 10 hours of working time each month**. Some users even save up to 5 working days.
- :question: When you show your analyses to someone else, there are always more questions coming up. Currently, you need to return to the backoffice in order to answer them. **With edaviz, you can answer many follow-up questions right on the spot**. Your colleagues, your customers, and your boss will like that.
- :repeat: Did you ever think "oh my god, now I have to do the same analyses again that I did 6 months ago"? Currently, you always code the same or similar analyses every few months. That's repetitive, redundant, and inefficient. **With edaviz, you will get instant analyses to the most common tasks** so that you have more time to focus on what's special about your current problem.
- :lock: Data Privacy: edaviz only needs online access to validate your license. Otherwise, you can work offline and your data stays where it belongs - on your computer.
